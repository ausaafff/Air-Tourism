# Air-Tourism

We analyzed data from 36 CSV files sourced from Kaggle, covering air tourism trends from 1970 to 2020. Using Power BI, we created dashboards to visualize:

 • Tourist growth
 • Environmental impacts through CO2 emissions
 • Safety insights (fatalities, hijackings)
 • Tourism’s contribution to GDP
 • Length of stay patterns, with insights into destinations like Hawaii and Cuba
 • Business vs. personal travel trends
 • The impact of employment in tourism and its link to GDP

This project truly highlighted the economic power of tourism and the need for sustainable practices!
